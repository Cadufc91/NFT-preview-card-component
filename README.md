## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned to take one step at a time to get to the final result. First organize your HTML file as a whole then go to your CSS file.

Once I managed to understand the necessary steps, it was easier to get to the final result.

### Continued development

Need to continue studying regards the ':hover' function and its possibilities.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for the CSS availability features. They have an example page where you can test if the function you were looking for was correct.
